# Default Installation instructions

If your project is a standard React Native project created using `react-native init` (it should have an ios/android directory), then follow these installation instructions:

If you already have this installed, or are using create-react-native-app, this isn't necessary.

`npm i react-native-vector-icons --save && react-native link react-native-vector-icons`

*If you have any issues with icons not working or installation of React Native Vector Icons, check out their installation guide [here](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation)*
